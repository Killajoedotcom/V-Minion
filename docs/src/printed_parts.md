## Official printed parts

Rat Rig provides the source files for all official printed parts in both STL and STEP formats. These can all be found on the [:material-github: {{ ratrig.product_name}} GitHub repository]({{ config.repo_url }}/tree/main/cad/). 

Alternatively, if preferred, the whole project repository can be downloaded in a [:material-download-box: single ZIP package]({{ config.repo_url }}/archive/main.zip).

## Electronics enclosure panels

The source files for the electronics enclosure panels are provided in three different formats to suit your induvidual needs.

- For laser cutting, industry standard DXF files are provided in both metric (millimeters) and imperial (inches) versions.
- For CNC routing, or CAD applications, industry standard STEP files are provided, again in both metric (millimeters) and imperial (inches) versions.
- Lastly, for 3D printing, STL files are provided if you wish to print your own electronics enclosure panels.

All of these can be found [:material-github: here on the GitHub repository]({{ config.repo_url }}/tree/main/cad/panels/). 

## CAD

The 3D CAD model is freely available to view and download from [:fontawesome-solid-folder-open: Onshape]({{ ratrig.cad_url }}){ target="_blank" }.

## Recommended print settings
